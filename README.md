# 📊 BoxIQ: StatStreak

BoxIQ is a machine learning-powered statline assistant for prop bettors, fantasy players, and curious sports fans. It predicts confidence on Over/Under outcomes using player trends, matchup history, and modeled probabilities — all from a sleek, intuitive interface.

> 🧠 Built with real data. Designed for real decisions.

## 🏀 What It Does

- 🔍 Enter any player’s statline (e.g. `Anthony Davis — 12.5 Rebounds`)
- 📈 Instantly receive:
  - Confidence % on Over and Under
  - AI-backed recommendation (Over/Under)
  - Context on odds value vs projected performance
- 🎯 Built to help bettors make smarter decisions without information overload

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- A lightweight machine learning model trained on:
  - Historical box score performance
  - Opponent and pace-of-play trends
  - Line movement and implied probability
- Converts odds and statlines into recommendation logic
- Confidence thresholding and "soft suggestions" — you're still in control

## ⚙️ Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, vanilla JS (React variant coming)
- **Backend Model**: Python / Scikit-learn → Converted to `.pkl`
- **Modeling**: Custom logic and data preprocessing pipelines (in progress)
